# Dry Bean Variety Classification

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Use machineâ€‘learning techniques to classify seven varieties of dry beans based on their physical measurements.

## ðŸš€ Contents
- **`MIniProject(1).html`**  
  A selfâ€‘contained HTML report (exported Jupyter Notebook) showing data exploration, model training, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.  
- **`Classifyingâ€‘Dryâ€‘Beanâ€‘Varietiesâ€‘withâ€‘ML.pptx`**  
  Slide deck summarizing methodology, key results, and deployment considerations.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, Scikitâ€‘learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook (exported to HTML)
- Microsoft PowerPoint

## ðŸ“‹ How to Use
1. **View the report**:  
   Open `MIniProject(1).html` in your browser to step through the code, charts, and model performance.  
2. **Presentation**:  
   Open the PPTX to see an executiveâ€‘style summary of approach and findings.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Highlights
- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, feature scaling  
- Models evaluated: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM  
- Best accuracy: 96.5% (Random Forest)  
- Confusion matrices and ROC curves included in the HTML report
